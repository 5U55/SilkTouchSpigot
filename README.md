# Silk Touch Spigot
This is a spigot plugin that allows players to pick up blocks with their bare hands as if they have silk touch. This means that any block the player destroys with their bare hands will only drop the block item of that block. This doesn't decrease the time it takes to destroy blocks by hand.


# Commands

**/silktouch <player>** gives the player the silk touch capabilities indefinitely, this data is stored even if the server is restarted or the player leaves/rejoins the game

**/silktouch** without the player name gives the person who entered the command the silk touch capabilities indefinitely

**/unsilktouch <player>**  revokes these silk touch capabilities

**/unsilktouch** without the player name can also be used to revoke the silk touch capabilities from the player that entered the command

**/checksilktouch <player>**  checks and displays a players silk touch capabilities

**/checksilktouch** without the player name can also be used check the silk touch capabilities of the player that entered the command

# Usage

Place the .jar file in the plugins folder on your spigot/bukkit compatible server
